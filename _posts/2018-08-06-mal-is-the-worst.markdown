*How NOT to CS 101: this.*



**Context: MyAnimeList is a site to track the anime you have watched. They had an issue with their API, so I moved to AniList** ~~and have yet to get the MAL account deleted.~~

Here's my tip: Don't sign up with a service that doesn't have an easy account deletion option.

Where to start with this? On my blog post about free hosting services, I brought this up, but now I'll go into more detail with it. Go look at that post first, as it'll have the context for this post.

Here's what my profile looked like (I even did my anime list but didn't screenshot it):
<figure>
	<a href="https://sheepkid12.gitlab.io/assets/images/posts/Round4-5.png"><img src="https://sheepkid12.gitlab.io/assets/images/posts/Round4-5.png"></a>

They eventually stopped responding to my Gmail email, so I moved it over to ProtonMail and we're back in business, [or are we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN25ghkfgQA) \*vsauce music plays*? Nope, absolutely fucking nowhere... *I'm not going to show those messages because they'll have my email.


I started linking them this video:

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MrJ9-UdPv8o?start=36" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*Just in case the link is dead, it was an animated video of Bo Burnham KYS song.*

During this time, i recorded 2 videos of my MAL profile. I have those 2 below (obviously redacted my bookmarks and other things).

My anime list page:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.plyr.io/3.5.3/plyr.css" />
<script src="https://cdn.plyr.io/3.5.3/plyr.js"></script>

<div class="container">
<video controls crossorigin playsinline id="player1">
	<source src="https://sheepkid12.gitlab.io/assets/video/untitledMAL1.mp4" type="video/mp4" size="720">
</video>
</div>
<br>
This was put together with some simple JavaScript and jpg files. Don't ask me why "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" from a Curious George album was being played...

Trying to get my profile from the archive machine (because somehow they have it):

<video controls crossorigin playsinline id="player2">
	<source src="https://sheepkid12.gitlab.io/assets/video/untitledMAL2.mp4" type="video/mp4" size="720">
</video>

<script>
const players = Plyr.setup('video', {captions: {active: true}});
window.players = players;
</script>

Here's some other various images that I have:

- I was on the user page at one point in time:

**The 2 variations of my anime page:**

Version 1:

<figure>
	<a href="https://sheepkid12.gitlab.io/assets/images/posts/ALp1.png"><img src="https://sheepkid12.gitlab.io/assets/images/posts/ALp1.png"></a>
</figure>

Version 2:

<figure>
	<a href="https://sheepkid12.gitlab.io/assets/images/posts/ALp2.png"><img src="https://sheepkid12.gitlab.io/assets/images/posts/ALp2.png"></a>
</figure>

Every other image I have is variations on my user profile page.

Like any other person, I somewhat took this to twitter, and found a MAL database manager, but I ranted at them and pissed them off now (which is great)...

**EDIT: I had tweets here, but I deleted my twitter account. The bottom sentence will stay (just because).**

The last email from MAL dates back to August 9, 2018 (if anyone was curious).

I hope the lazy tweed embed system works here and doesn't screw me over as bas as MAL has...

Edit (March 19, 2019): Leave it to me to find more things to add to this (and keep updating this repo daily thanks to a script). I copied the ENTIRE ProtonMail email log (and obviously redacted any names and my email) with more images too.

[Here's](https://sheepkid12.gitlab.io/mal-convo) the entire message log.

And finally, to hopefully conclude this entire thing: the last picture I have from my phone (dated July 11, 2018 at 11:31 PM - I remember where I was when I did this: downstairs with the TV on the couch watching my brother at my mom's place). God I was up late that night.

My phone also has other variations of my profile, but I already have them here.

2020 edit: and I thought they were bad? Oh boy, let me introduce you to Coinbase...
