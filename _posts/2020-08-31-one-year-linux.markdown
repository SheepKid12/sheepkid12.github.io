*I'm back (for now at least). What better post to come back with than a post about Linux?*

Looking through my git repo archive of this thing (wondering what to do with it), I stumbled across my old (what I'll call) journey into Linux post (where Windows and wireless don't work so I go to KDE neon). That post was in March(?) of 2019, and time really does fly.

**I've been using Linux for more than a year.**

Jeez.

I dislike my click-baity title, but what do I think about it? **It's still as usable as I said it was one year ago.** The only notable issue I can remember is when I was trying to figure out why my DNS settings would not apply. Turns out, it was a broken symlink somewhere that I found out about from my older HP laptop that was running Xubuntu at the time. Other than that, I did an SSD upgrade and went to Manjaro.

What do I think about Manjaro (which is Arch based)? Different package manager aside, there is no obvious differences (other than a libreoffice thing that won't go away from my start menu). Would I recommend it to a new user? **No.** While you can call it stable, there may be a time where somehting goes weird with an update to where an average user wouldn't know how to solve it. Yes, that same issue could happen in something like Ubuntu, but not as much.

For a new user, my opinion is: Linux Mint is your best bet. It's got the solid foundation of Ubuntu (which is based off the not-so-stable right now Debian) + the Cinnamon desktop (which out of the box on Mint looks very similar to Windows).

I have since updated my other linux posts with updated information.
