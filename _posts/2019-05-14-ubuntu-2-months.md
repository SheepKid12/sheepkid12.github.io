*It's now been almost 2 months, and I want to put an update on my Linux install out there. What do I think of it after 2 months?*

Short version: I **love** it. I enjoy having a system that I can use and not worry about constant maintainance just to keep the thing going good (forced updates). Stability is rock solid, and Ubuntu doesn't send data constantly to Canonical like Windows does to M$ (Canonical does have `ubuntu-report`, but the data they get is published(?), and it doesn't seem like it's anything bad). Canonical only gets system hardware and other basic info. I haven't had any _major_ issues (other than the day one curse I seem to have, see my pc breaking post for more on that).

Here's what I'm calling the full thing (which is still going to be short).

- Stability: perfect. I have (so far) not had any major issue I couldn't find my way out of without rebooting. Updates also work every time (which is what you would expect). _I do still add things to the script I think was mentioned in the first post, but not as often anymore._

- Music Management: I switched to a Pixel 3a XL late 2019 (the iPhone was giving me too many battery issues), meaning I can use Syncthing to sync pictures and music between devices. Also, GPM is going away and being replaced with YT Music. ~~I went with Google, so I had to re-tag everything to match Google's way of doing it on the web interface. With help from PlayOnLinux and mp3tag, the process was very easy. Problem is, the music manager put a cron job to check every single day for it's repository and other things, so I got that out of there as soon as I caught it (which was from me looking in Synaptic).~~

- Media Player: Lollypop is very good, and just seems to be getting better. It's my default now.

- KRunner: Still never found a use for it. It's toggled by Alt+Space, which isn't really that nice of a key combo. I've stuck to using the search from the application launcher.

- Weird Bug (the only one I can remember that was recent at initial post time): I've had a blank file show up in my search, and clicking on it gives me a malformed url error. It resolves itself after a while, but it's weird. 2021 edit: I'm still seeing this bug, but on Arch Linux now. Also MTP devices (samsung phones) refusing to connect for whatever reason...

On to KDE Plasma: I love it still. It's by far one of the most customizable DE's out there for Linux (and the 5.16 beta is coming up soon, but I'll stay on user edition). My only issue is with Discover: it's slow... 

Do I miss anything from Windows? **Nope.** Everything I do now (from basic videos to doing this) is all done in FOSS (free and open source) software.
