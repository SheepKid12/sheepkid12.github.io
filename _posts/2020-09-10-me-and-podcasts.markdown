*Still following through on my "comeback", but this time, I had the idea to post about my obsession/maybe addiction with podcasts.*

I don't exactly remember how the story goes, but there was a post somewhere on Reddit (r/privacy and a "degoogle" thread) mentioning a podcast ("The Privacy, Security & OSINT Show" to be specific). I remember that night (or a night after) trying to look for a podcast app on my parent's crappy Android tablet (I think it was overcast somehow, which I don't know where I found that one from, but I'm guessing zollotech). This is what led me down the rabbit hole (although technically, "This Week in Linux" on YouTube is the first podcast I attempted to listen to, not knowing what it was). *How I found out about TuxDigital is anyone's guess at this point (was it the video where he talked about why Plasma would have been better for mainline Ubuntu?).*

I looked and looked for a free app for my iPhone, and landed on:

### Radio Public

From there, I looked for anime podcasts (because why not). One Player FM search later landed me: Anime Addicts Anonymous (which I didn't listen to for a while, and thought the intro was weird), Otaku Spirit, and Anime Club After Dark. For some reason, I didn't listen to some of the podcasts I had added for a while. I don't know why I did this, but I did.

An early OPML export shows that I was also listening to Clockwise, (found from looking for tech podcasts), TWiNL (this week in linux) and anime summit (also didn't listen to this one for a while).

### Overcast

I switched to Overcast for some reason (maybe it was because Radio Public had their own podcast directory that didn't have everything). **This is where it really takes off.** I started to add Linux podcasts from Jupiter Broadcasting, and I added some from Overcast's recommendations (RT Podcast, Random But Memorable, etc.) Techmeme Ride Home also makes an appearance from an Accidental Tech Podcast ("John is My Default", I think), and more. I counted 22 in the OPML export from this time frame.

### Pocket Casts

I initially remember this one being paid (which it was until an update). I decided to switch to this one because Random But Memorable's cover art was having issues (and I typically switch things when one thing bothers me). This is where I currently sit (with almost **50** podcasts). Take that number in for a few seconds...

~50 podcasts...

I also was considering at some points switching to Google Podcasts, and my curiousity in anime podcasts led me to "Anime Out of Context". What a way to start my sundays off now.

Too many, I know... One could say it's an addiction. It may go up to 50 if JB brings some new shows up (they just brought LAN & CR back).
