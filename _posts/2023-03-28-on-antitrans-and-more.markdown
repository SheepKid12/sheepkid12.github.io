Once again, yeah: I'm still alive. I just haven't had anything to discuss recently (until the morning of March 28, 2023). Waking up to hear the news of yet another shooting at a school breaks my heart, and scares me. That plus the many bills aimed at the LGBT community have me wanting to get all of this out of my head and out somewhere. Even if it's just going to the void, I don't care. It's my corner of the internet, and I can choose what to put on it.

## Anti-Trans Legislation

I don't think I'm only trans person who is scared for what the US is becoming. You know it's bad when there's a [site](https://translegislation.com/) dedicated to tracking all of this. From the infamous (in the wrong ways) "don't say gay" bill to plenty of other ones, 2023 has been an utter shit show for people like us. Sure: I am fortunate enough to be in a state and position where I don't feel as worried about this kind of stuff hitting my neck of the woods, but I can't say that much about other states. Most of what I'm seeing seems to be going against trans youth (whether it be discussion in schools to outright banning trans youth from getting the healthcare they need). Don't get me wrong, I personally don't think kids should be taking HRT right away, but that's what puberty blockers are for. In my opinion, allowing the kid to at least experiment with gender identity and expression while not fearing their AGAB puberty is how I think stuff like that *should* happen.

Thing is: elected officials don't seem to get it. They don't understand us or our struggles. They try to downplay our existence as a whole. Trying to silence us, when we won't stay down. We will fight back, and I'm positive we **will win.**

Sorry, I veered off to a side tangent there. If anyone other than me is reading, **please contact your elected officials.** Let them know that stuff like this isn't going to fly with the general population.

Thing is: I fear it'll get worse, and we have this to blame...

## The School Shooting

Yup, we\'92re taking a trip down to Nashville for yet another round of: "[why can't they just pass legislation against this already?](https://abcnews.go.com/US/multiple-patients-reported-amid-active-aggressor-nashville-school)"? *editors note: this links out to ABC News. Personally, I think this was one of the the better articles I skimmed through this morning after hearing this on [What a Day](https://crooked.com/podcast-series/what-a-day/). My bias is also showing here.*

If you don't want to click the link, that's fine. Let me summarize:

There was yet another school shooting that took place in Nashville, TN. Initial reports had the person known as a female, but later it was found they were AFAB, but trans FTM.

Now, on the surface: you\'92d think there\'92s nothing too crazy here, right? Well, take a look at that trans legislation page and say that again with a straight face. I'm positive this will spark some hatred or something against people like us. More than it\'92s been in recent months. Only time will tell.

Anyways, that's all from me for now. I feel better now knowing that I don\'92t have to keep holding these thoughts in my head.
