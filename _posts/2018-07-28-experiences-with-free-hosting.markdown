*Free hosting comes at a cost. This one I wasn't quite prepared for.*



Let me preface all of this by saying I didn't care that much about privacy back then compared to now. All of that could be thanks to youtubers like Switched to Linux and Quidsup. I do have some privacy issues now with the service I'm going to mention, and also because of a completely different issue.

I don't exactly remember what I was thinking at the time I signed up for this one free hosting service (5gbfree), but I can't recommend them. I think I registered an account so I could try hosting an Ubuntu archive for myself (I was randomly testing older versions of Ubuntu, they do exist). That didn't work at all, and now I'm stuck with the account, and constant emails saying I need to re-verify some SSL certificates. I've attempted to use their forums to fix this issue, but they don't let you sign up, and their "contact us" button never gets me anywhere. I've had to specifically filter out their "spam" in my email now to force them to be deleted (they used to go straight to spam, not anymore. Thanks Google.).

I have the same sort of feelings to a completly different service, MyAnimeList. For anyone out of the loop, they had an API issue that required they close the entire site down for almost a week. They're back now, but only somewhat, as most of their features are still down. I've been trying since they came back up to get my account deleted, and I've gotten nowhere with it. I have given up to the point where I've cussed them out on my [profile page](https://myanimelist.net/profile/SheepKid12) (now a dead link, see screenshot below).

Here's what that looks like:

I would be asking for comments about similar experiences with sites like this, but since I don't like Disqus (and have disabled them on this site), you can't.
