*Beta software is supposed to have issues, OK? That's why it's not daily driver material...*



Since this was a very much one-off bug, I have put the [context](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/9jk0mp/question_software_update_notification_badge/) needed to understand the rest of thos post. When iOS 12.1's beta released, iOS 12 users that came from the beta were seeing the notification after removing the beta profile.I had decided to take this to Apple's support team, and here's what I got out of that month or 2 old convertation. Note that all names were replaced with "ME", "Person 1" and 2 (you'll see what I mean).

**WARNING: VERY LONG.**

> Here's the transcript of your chat with Apple Support:

> Duration: 41 minutes 46 seconds

> Person 1: Thanks for contacting Apple Support. My name is Person 1. How can I help you?

> Person 1: Hi ME. My name is Person 1. Hope you're having an amazing day today. Thank you for chatting in. I'm looking forward to being of assistance to you. I am chatting from the USA. To better serve you, may I have your country of residence as well?

> ME: My device shows a notification badge for (what I can assume) is the iOS 12.1 beta, but I don't have the beta profile installed (only a VPN root CA thing).

> ME: I saw a post on Reddit that said to sign out and back into iCloud, but that didn't work.

> Person 1: A notification badge for an update, but you're not on the beta?

> Person 1: Hmmm, that is a bit odd and interesting.

> ME: iOS 12 GM.

> Person 1: Ahhh, the GM version?

> Person 1: When did you last update to iOS 12?

> ME: When the final release came out..

> ME: Like I said, I'm not the only one: https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/9jk0mp/question_software_update_notification_badge/?st3DJMMOQH2

> ME: Correction, the final beta.

> Person 1: Just to verify, not the final beta, but the full version one that was released after the keynote?

> ME: Yes.

> Person 1: Ok, then that's why you're getting that notification.

> Person 1: If it's the final beta, then you'll want to get the full public version.

> ME: My device thinks it's up to date.

> ME: Isn't the final beta also the GM release that gets sent out to everyone?

> Person 1: Let me get the resource article that shows how to downgrade form the beta to the full release public version so we can get this resolved.

> Person 1: Actually, the final beta and the public release are not the same.

\*yes, they are.\*
 
> ME: Build number: 16A366

> ME: Not a beta.

> ME: I know what beta build numbers look like.

> ME: They're longer.

> ME: Bugs like these show how broken your OS is.

> ME: Did you even see the Reddit post? Other people with the same error, all on the same "final" release.

\*silence for a few minutes.\*

> ME: Hello?

> Person 1: Yes, ME. 

> Person 1: I did see the Reddit post and appreciate that. I've been reviewing that and looking for this for you.

> Person 1: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT203282

> ME: Like I said, I'm NOT ON THE BETA.

> ME: I have you the build number, and it's the final release, not a beta.

> ME: The betas have longer build numbers for a reason.

> Person 1: I definitely understand your frustration and I'm working hard on this to find you a resolution to get things up and working for you.

> ME: ðŸ¤¬

> Person 1: Just to verify, did you go directly from the Beta to the public version?

> ME: Should have.

> ME: I think it was a "beta", but it was really the final release.

> Person 1: Ok. Let's do this.

> ME: Do you need that build number again?

> Person 1: I have it

> Person 1: Build number: 16A366

> ME: Yes.

> ME: To me, that looks like the final release build number.

> ME: I'd rather not downgrade and risk loosing any data.

> Person 1: Give me about 3-5 minutes to look into this further for you and I'll be right back.

> ME: Oh my god. Seriously?

> ME: ðŸ˜¤

> Person 1: (still working on it for you)

> ME: K.

> Person 1: Thanks for your patience. I have been speaking to my senior advisor, Person 2, about your issue. They would like to go ahead and speak with you directly about the issue. Would it be okay if I sent Person 2 over to you now?

> ME: Please do.

> ME: I'll just keep waiting.

> Person 1: Ok

> Person 1: I'll connect you now.

> Person 1: Take care and have a great day.

> ME: You too.

\*out goes person 1, here comes person 2\*

> Person 2: Thanks for contacting Apple Support. Please give me a moment to look over your information.

> Person 2: Appreciate your patience, hope you are well ME. Outside of this device having this many software update issues here! I have read the last chat so I should be able to pick up quickly where we left off for sure.

> Person 2: Just to confirm the phone is still on 12.1 now, correct?

> ME: 12.0

> ME: The GM.

> ME: I already told the other person that.

> ME: You must have gotten the wrong info.

> ME: I also linked a post from a Reddit dedicated to beta testing your software to the other person, and people there are having the same issue as me.

> ME: https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/9jk0mp/question_software_update_notification_badge/?st3DJMMPICP0

> Person 2: I have all that information and we appreciate it ME.

> Person 2: So, the idea here in order to resolve... Let's try doing some troubleshooting and In case we exhaust our outlets here and no change, I will be sure to get your information passed along to our Engineers and keep this going via a callback.

> Person 2: We can get you in on an Engineer ticket no problem.

> ME: Ok then.

> Person 2: Can you take me some screenshots from your phone?

> ME: What do you need?

> Person 2: The badge that is stuck and settings > general > about.

\*I sent the support person the images requested\*

> ME: Is that what you needed? Also, sorry for the disconnect, I had to enable photo access to the Apple support app.

> Person 2: All good and thats it yes. Let me get a callback number for you ME, in case our chat drops I want to be able to reach you again.

> ME: Nope.

> ME: Do I have to give a phone number? I'd rather not.

> ME: The only reason it dropped was because I needed photo access to your support app.

> Person 2: Well so this is how we can get you on an Engineer report, and follow up with the findings from the investigation to the case.

> ME: Nope.

> ME: Why can't you send up what you have now? OH WAIT, THIS IS APPLE I'M TALKING TO. The company that throttled iPhones due to older batteries and told nobody, and the company with shitty keyboards and overheating.

> Person 2: Im sorry you feel this way ME, well I can go ahead and ke ep the case information open for us and if you do want us to go through with that by all means we can for sure. In the mean time I would like to help resolve the actual issue with the badge icon.

> Person 2: That can be done by restoring your OS. From there if no change we would recommend an Engineer report be complete.

> ME: I'd rather NOT reset my phone.

> ME: This is an endless loop of nothing.

> Person 2: I am providing you with valid ways to troubleshoot  the issue ME. This is how we resolve this for you here is with attempting a few things. 

> ME: BTW, one person was told to sign out of iCloud and back, and here I am getting nowhere.

> Person 2: I couldn't really speak for others, i can only really speak for the issue itself and with where I feel we would need to go next in order to resolve. I have outlined this through the restore in iTunes, and if no change let us call you and complete that ticket. These are the options we have currently. 

> ME: I DO NOT WANT TO RESTORE MY PHONE.

\*fuck this shit i'm out GIF was added to the chat log here, not visible in this log.\*

> ME: Fuck, the gif didn't work.

> Person 2: Understood, well so I have very little other options I have in order to troubleshoot here ME. 

> ME: Other than update to the beta, or just fix your fucking OS.

> ME: OH WAIT! This is just the support people. Let's not go into how shit your Apple certified repair shops are.

> Person 2: I understand the frustrations you may be having here, and I am here to help with them in any way we can ME. The thing is, we have valid steps to take right now in order to resolve this for you here, but I do ask that we try to keep this to a professional conversation and focus on getting this resolved for us for sure.

> Person 2: We can attempt a restore of the OS, and do the Engineer report, but these are the main steps I would like to start with today for a permanent resolve.

> ME: No restore for me, sorry.

> Person 2: Understood.

> ME: I guess I'm fucked, right? Well, how many times have you fucked over the average consumer with your shit?

> ME: I'm about ready to end this chat, as your way to incompetent to see what I'm saying.

> Person 2: Apologies you feel this way here ME. I am better able to serve you if you refrain from using profanity. Let's work together to address your concerns.

> ME: Fine. What do you want me to do now?

> ME: Other than restore my device.

> Person 2: Well so, we can attempt to back up the data and restore your phone from here in order to resolve. If not we can call you and get you in on an Engineer ticket for sure. Apologies but these are the next steps to take.

> ME: Fuck this shit I'm out.

\*end of support chat.\*

So, this person didn't seem to know what the final version was (they always release the version that gets released to everyone at a keynote or something). Why do I even try to deal with support people any more?
