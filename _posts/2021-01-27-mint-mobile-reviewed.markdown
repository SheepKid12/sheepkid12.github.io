*Is their $15 a month plan all it's hyped up to be?*

**Disclosures:** Nobody is paying me to say anything good about Mint. All of what you're going to read is my genuine experiences using their services. Service has been tested on a factory unlocked S20 FE 5G (using the TMo APN, due to some issues I'll talk about later on).

After a long time of trying to deal with putting $75/mo. for the family line I was on with AT&T, I decided to port out and go to somewhere else. Knowing me, I want to try to save as much money as I can (due to an inconsistent work schedule and me trying to be money smart, unlike my parents). My options were as follows: Mint Mobile's 3mo/3gb plan (now a 4gb plan) or Ting's new plans.

Ting was already out of the question, since I knew that I would need international calling/text, and luckily I saw a video from Stetson Doggett saying they would still need to work out the kinks with their intl. plans. Mint Mobile it was then.

Now, for the part you were probably looking for:

**Porting Process:** 4/5. I had some "issues" with AT&T not wanting to give up the number so easily, so I had to contact CS and tell them that they'd need to restart the process. Other than that, I was able to keep my current number (which was very important to me, since I don't want to try to change my 2FA at work).

**CS:** 4/5. They can be helpful and confusing at the same time. During my port process, they said they'd restarted the process, but didn't tell me that they had re-initiated the port, so that was a good few minutes of confusion from me. The other times I've contacted them were about MMS (see below.

**Device Setup:** 4/5. MMS failed to function on the `ulta` APM, so I had to default back to the TMo Fast whatever one just for that to work for me. Everything else after that point was good.

**Coverage:** 3/5. **10Mbps on "5G"??** That plus apps taking FOREVER to load (trying to load my schedule takes forever on data). I also occasionally loose that "5G" coverage and get dropped down to 3G (NOTE: The area in question apparently does have "5G" coverage, so that shouldn't have even been a problem in the first place, right?). I have seen better speed at other places, but doing constant speedtests really burns through data quickly.

**Overall:** If you can deal with the things you'll have to loose, you're getting a good deal for your money. Just be ready to do some tweaking on Android devices to make sure everything else works.
