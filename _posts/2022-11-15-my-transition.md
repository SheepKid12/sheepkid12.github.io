*ARCHIVE: gender transition posts combined (see update post for context).*



If you've read the update post, you'll know why these are all being combined into one post. I won't get into the specifics here, but there are some things happening that I need to focus on more than this.



## 1 Week Post (11-15-2022)

*How I'm doing after all but one week of gender transition.*

Whelp, if you couldn't clearly tell from all the other places I am online, you'll probably have figured out that I'm a trans female. A trans female that was just able to start her transition all but a week ago, and here is her report.

For a bit of backstory as to why I'm just starting a week ago, I would need to talk about my drivers license situation. That was one heck of a thing to get. I had to use a friend of my brother's car to do the test, since mine had a broken wiring harness for the headlamp on the driver side. His car had absolutely zero power steering, so that thing was stiff as a rock. Ultimately, I did pass, and then it was a matter of getting the appointment scheduled.

That was a different beast of it's own. I initially was planning on doing it during a work day (I'd call protected time off for the rest of the day and get it all said and done), but my brother wanted to have a day with his former GF, so I begrudgingly said yes and took the time off. That took me down to not enough time, so I tried to get regular paid time off. That didn't work either, so I had to schedule the appointment even later on. Luckily: I'm off at 2PM, and the Planned Parenthood nearest to me had a 3PM appointment they could slot me into. I happily took that and now the rest is history.

**What's Different so Far**

Honestly, not much to report for this first week. Other than what I think may be some softening skin when it comes to my hands, I have noticed that my mental state has very much improved. 

Now, let me let you in on a "secret": I've been taking anxiety and depression medication for a bit now, and it worked well initially, but 2021 came around and threw all of that out the window when I stumbled upon the subreddit that would bring me here. I'm not saying that the medication suddenly had less of an effect on me (as it still does to this day, but seemingly to a lesser effect), but I feel as if it was just undiagnosed gender dysphoria that was causing a good portion of my problems.

I hope to make this a series on here, so that others can hopefully come to it and see what kind of things they can expect when they start their transition for themselves. Do realize though: this is for the male-to-female crowd out there, so I have no idea what the female-to-male side of things looks like. Honestly, as of right now: I don't see myself turning back from taking these pills.



## 2 Weeks Post (11-22-2022)



*How 2 weeks of the stuff has affected me (if at all).*

**Yes, I know that technically this has been published a day early. sosumi.** Whelp, we've crossed over the 1 week mark officially, and we've entered into week 2. I would make a SpongeBob reference, but I've decided to not do that.

**Here's what's different**

Honestly, there's still not much to report. Other than the occasional tingles or whatever they call them near where *they* will soon be, nothing much. I do have some interesting stories to share already...

**The unintentional early-early dose (and missed dose)**

Picture this: it's ~2AM, and you've come down with hiccups yet again. In an effort to get them gone, you decide to take your spiro and e (since hey: drinking water was the solution for a bit). Want to know what I forgot to do when I did that? Log it in the iOS health app (since yes, that's a feature that exists). I *almost* double-dosed on that day (as in, at 4AM, when I usually wake up for the day), but I did catch myself before it was too late.

What's also somewhat funny here is that I don't really recall taking them, but upon counting all my pills, there was 1 extra in both of them. What happened here: I got home from work that same day and crashed hard. So hard, I made it into the next day. I honestly still don't know how I did this.

**The accidental oral e (please no rush e references here)**

So, my pill bottles are usually laid out on my table as such: spiro on the left, e on the right. Somehow on the night of the 21st, they got mixed up, and when I went to take my pills, I accidentally took a estradiol pill down the hatch without even realizing it. Hopefully (since it's just one pill) it won't kill me or my liver (please don't make an SMG4 reference). Lesson learned: double check (and at least feel the pill) so you know which one is in your hand. I have also written "S" and "E" on both of the respective bottles, so hopefully there will be less of a mix up for the next time.

Here's to hopefully seeing some breast growth in the next few weeks or so! I did see some people on Reddit saying that average time for them to start coming in is about 3 weeks, so I'm about a week or (if worse comes to worse) more away from some chest pains (which are going to suck hard, but hey: it is what it is).

What a week this has been. Hopefully I'll be back next week with some good news.


## 3 Weeks Post (11-29-2022)


*Documenting how it's been, now 3 weeks in (and a tale of woe added in for good measure!)*

First off, I do want to apologize for the "delay" publishing the 2 week one. Let me recall the tale of woe that prompted it (this is an ATP reference):

Be me, just trying to push out the 2 week transition update post to GitLab. Commit message done, everything looks good to push. It's up, and CI starts to build it. A few minutes later, a red X appears. Oh shit. What happened now?

Honestly, I still don't know what happened, but luckily I was able to save the 2 week and a few other things from a bad idea of a git hard reset. Luckily: everything is just working as it was again. I tried a random build, and it just worked. So: I made a merge request with all the changes to add the missing post back in and went on my day. Just don't do it on your phone at work, ya dingus.

*ahem*

Back on track now: I hate to sound like a broken record, but threre really hasn't been much development from these weeks. I'm sure something is going to start soon (my thing does say ~1-3 months for breast growth), but I'm honestly not holding out too much hope.

TW: detransition thoughts

I have also thought about giving up all of this "trans" stuff a few times also. What keeps me taking the pills is the thought of going back to a life of trying to live as an AMAB individual, and how terrible that would be. For now at least, I have decided to stick it out and see what happens. I am impatient as heck too, so that's playing a bit into this also.

Whelp, I think that concludes this week. A tale of woe that magically fixed itself and some deep thoughts. What'll happen next week? Hopefully not GitLab imploding on me again.


## 4 Weeks Post (12-06-2022)


*Now 4 weeks in, has she FINALLY noticed something? Anything?*

Somehow I've remembered to publish this weekly. I'm almost a month in now, and here's what I've got going for me:

**Smell (BO)**

Definitely smells different, but not like what I was expecting. Also, not as much in terms of liquid coming out (probably because it's cold outside), but the smell has increased, even though I'm still putting on deodorant as normal.

**boobs?**

Still, sadly, no boobs. BUT: I do think they may be coming soon. I do feel as if I am feeling more things in that general area that kind of lead me to believe that something's finally going to happen there. Can I finally join the itty bitty titty committee? Find out soon, I guess!

**Strength**

This one's a mixed bag, since I haven't really done as many things that require lifting heavy objects recently, but I felt as if it was going away, and the items were getting harder to lift up. Granted: I'm weak as is, but still.

**Hands**

Softening as they have since the first few weeks. I *think* they're also getting smaller, but I didn't take any before and after pictures for that.

**Forgetting my Pills**

Yup. I somehow missed ANOTHER pill this week. There's probably going to be a count of how many I've done. This was the 6PM one too, so that's something.


*Missed pill count: 2* (we'll make an official counter here)

## I don't know at this point (December 27, 2022)

First off: hopefully everyone had a great holiday season, and wishing everyone the best in the new year to come. I'm scared to go into a new year knowing I'll be a different looking person at the end of it, but here we are.

Second: Yeah, it's been a bit. Things were slow for the time I archived this post. Now things are picking up, and I'd like to start documenting it all again. Starting off with none other than the (what I'm going to call) boing boings.

I think they're finally starting to show up (there's more in those general areas compared to what I had before starting), and they feel sensitive or something. The right one rubbing up against my shirt all day while at work today was not the most pleasant thing to deal with, but that tells me it's working. Also: sleeping on them (as I've always seemed to have done) is starting to become less and less appealing, as they hurt when slept on.

What else? Oh, *that*...

Trigger warning ahead, as this gets deep...

The last few days at work have been rough mentally. I've had all kinds of thoughts about ending transition and my life. Lots of it stems from Christmas day. I went to go visit my dad's side of the family (where my dad leans more into the Fox News kind of crowd), and leaving that night prompted me to start getting emotional. I haven't gotten that way in a long time, so that was quite the change to see. Weird form of euphoria, I guess.

Back to what I was saying: I'd hate to have to cut him out just because of me being the way I am. Maybe it's also something to do with me not knowing how people at work will handle it, but where I work has a decent policy regarding people in the community (and there have been people who used to work at the store who were more open about their side of the story).

I've come to realize that I feel more comfortable leaning into the tomboyish side of things. I don't really want to give up watching fucked content like what the Goons (McNasty, Soup, Blarg and TheDooo) make, and I also don't want to go highly fem. It seems like ads always push the extremes on both sides of the gender coin. Highly masc or fem: no in-between. I don't feel that way, sorry. I want pant pockets, damnit!
