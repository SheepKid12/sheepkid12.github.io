*My long-term, 1 year review of the budgeting app: You Need a Budget.*

First off: happy new year! It's great to still be here ready for content in the new year. I hope to bring all kinds of new and interesting stuff here. Maybe we'll move to self-hosting later on in the year, but we'll just have to see for that. Keep on the lookout though.

Now, on to the main event: YNAB. How I found it and how it changed the way I look at money.

If you remember the old post about how addicted to podcasts I am, I recall mentioning the accidental tech podcast. On one of their episodes (if I looked long enough, I could find it), they mentioned this app. I curiously looked into it, but got turned away because of the price tag. Almost $100 USD for an app like this? It better be worth it. I initially turned away from it. Almost a year ago now, I rediscovered that episode due to curiosity, and decided this time was the time to take the plunge. At the time, my money situation was getting a bit more on the rough side. I refused to go into banking apps just because of whatever weird reasons of the day I thought up. That plus all the random spending was finally getting to me in a way that I thought that some kind of action was necessary.

And so: my budgeting adventures began!

## My first few days

Were nothing more than interesting. I was starting later on in a month, so in my opinion, it wasn't really the best time to start something like this. Somehow I made it through. Their videos on their channel are a great help too, so definitely take a look into those if you're ever stuck. If that doesn't work, there's always their excellent support team. They've been there every issue I've ever had with the app (most of them being silly little issues with direct import).

Speaking of direct import: that was one of the main things that intrigued me about YNAB. I tried budgeting before with Excel spreadsheets (of which I do still have surprisingly), but never found it to work. The manual labor of inputting all those new transactions was too much for me to handle. That plus spreadsheets not being that readily accessible on mobile devices was a real detractor to that method (have you **looked** at a spreadsheet on mobile?). Direct import on the other hand takes most of that hassle away. Just link your bank account and away you go. Don't rely on it though, as it's dropped out on me more than a few times.

## About a month or so in

The dust was starting to settle, and I was slowly building up the habits to put new transactions in as they happen. To this day: I still miss a few here and there, but once direct import comes in, it all comes back to me. I finally had some sense of control over my money. Some things were still making it through the cracks and getting incorrectly categorized, but most everything was starting to fall in place.

Honestly, I can only really remember a few things: the start, the forced bank switches (I won't be discussing that here), and current day.


Speaking of current day: how am I holding up almost a year in?

Surprisingly very well!

My system is way more streamlined, and I've got categories and groups that all make sense. Fixed categories are ones I don't touch no matter what, and flexible (including everything else except savings goals and my emergency fund) are fair game to pull from in case I need to break said glass. Yes, this was stolen from a heard it from Hannah video on their channel, but it just *works* for my brain.

Sure, I still make some silly decisions here and there, but knowing that I'm about a month or 2 ahead with everything else it enough for me to be a bit more ok with it.

So, to summarize: YNAB is one awesome app. If you haven't given it a try yet, PLEASE DO! You'll see what I mean. I'm not sponsored or anything by these people. I'm just recommending an app that I can personally vouch for. They even offer a risk-free trial for 34 days, so give them a shot and see what you think.
