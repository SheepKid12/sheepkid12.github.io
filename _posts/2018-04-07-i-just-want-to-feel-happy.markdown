*Archive of an old Weebly post that I decided to archive here. Here for historical purposes.*



Why do I feel like absolute crap recently? It seems like everything I do gets me yelled at, and everything seems to come back to me for some reason.

Maybe it's just me...

Also, it's been 2 years since I last checked this site (it seems like every 2 years I check this).

I'll probably see this again in 2 years (2020) and question what I was thinking.


2020 edit: 2018 me was sadly right...

**Context: I used to have some random stick figure weebly site, and I eventually found it again, and re-did some of it. Since I dislike weebly (and because this works), I've archived this post here. This will be the only post I archive to here, as the other 2 are not worth anyone's time to see (except for maybe this one...)**
