*Personal experiences in me not liking myself. Please read the note I left after the update.*

**SERIOUS NOTE: This was written at a very bad point in my life. If I ever do decide to put this back up, do know that I feel much better now, but I am on something to help an unrelated issue. I did get out of that stress-inducing place too with most (if not, all) of my belongings.**

This post makes me genuinely sad. This is a time capsule of what my feelings were at some point. They were **bad**... I seriously considered nuking this completely, but I thought it'd keep it up.

~~SORRY FOR THE AUTOPLAYING YOUTUBE VIDEO LINK. IT'S ONLY SAD PIANO MUSIC.~~

This will probably be my most serious post on my own personal blog **ever.** I don't know what's gotten into me, but sometimes I feel like absolute shit. I may need actual help **(2020 edit: I got help for an unrelated thing)**, but for now, nothing bad has happened to me (other than my parents). My fucking parents. Where do I start with them?

They don't seem to understand me, except for my mom (thanks, mom). I can at least say what's on my mind without getting yelled at by my dad (with my phone being taken away). They have a 20-ish year teen/adult that sits around all day and plays XBox. I'm almost to the point where I want to purposefully cut off his internet (XFinity lets you do that from the admin panel) as a simple "fuck you. get a job you lazy fuck."

I tell my step-mom(?) that she needs to do something about it, and she says that I think I know everything, and that something is happening about that. FUCK OFF, NOTHING HAS EVER HAPPENED AND NOTHING EVER WILL. YOU'RE A PIECE OF SHIT THAT I THINK NEEDS TO GO BURN IN HELL. 

They also drag my little brother into church (they did me also, but they stopped), and he HATES IT (I do too). I wish they were not this way, but I'm fucked either way.

I'm also in some trade school thing for a Cisco networking class, and I'm slowly hating that also, even though I was perfectly fine with it before. I'm legit crying at the time I posted this (maybe because of the music that you should be able to hear). I have no way out of this. I need to find a way out somehow, but there's nothing. It's like an endless tunnel with no light at the end of it to tell you that you made it. Permanatly stuck in this "hell" with my parents. Somebody help me out of this. Nobody will, sadly. What do I do instead?

As one of the doki's in Doki Doki Literature Club said, "Get out of my head." I completly agree with this. To my dad: get out of my fucking head, please. Also, to my little brother, the wiggles makes you look like a CHILD. GROW. THE. FUCK. UP. NOBODY WILL ACCEPT YOU LIKE YOU ARE. Either way, nobody accepts me the way I am, so I can't say a fucking thing.

And we're back again with round "oh fuck it, I give up at this point", added the day before April Fools Day, 2019:

Context: That cisco class is out this week, but my "home" school is still in, so I need someone to take me home. My parents have ignored me/straight-up told me no. This started in a sticky note widget on KDE Plasma and was transfered to a text file after a semi crash (not fully, but the mouse didn't do anything on-screen for a minute or 2).

The text reads (with some changes from the original I was typing):

guess i'll die (quoting the meme for context)...

no, seriously...

i'm just so uselsss in this thing called a society that I'm just forced into almost everything my parents do because they want to control EVERY FUCKING ASPECT of how I think and do literally anything (over-exagerated but OK). If I spelled that wrong, whatever. I hate it and want to leave. Maybe it's not actual abuse, but it's still enough verbally to the point where it makes me question why I'm still here. All of this is coming from one thing: (a-hole person) being a little piece of shit that won't get off of her lazy a-double and do something she probably should do regardless of what I say to her. It pisses me off to the point where I say and want to do the horrible things I type on a screen that only I can see now. Nobody will see this other than me and maybe Canonical (if they do shit like that, I'm on KDE neon). If this were M$ we're talking about, they would have called some sucicide prevention hotline on some random Windows 10 user they know more about than even the user knows about themself (not really, but one would think that could possibly happen at one point). 

Why am I still here? Why bother? There's nothing I can do about this: I've been perma-fucked because of the shit one person has given me (make that 2 actually). This is why I don't want to succeed in anything I do. I might fail Rite of Passage, I'll fail Film & Fiction because "fuck that class". It's nothing I'll need past HS, so why teach it to anyone? Unless you want to become a movie critic, there's no reason to be watching rated R movies just for the purpose of "analyzing" them. Sometimes I think: how can I turn this into my worst failure of any school year so far?

I just somehow recovered from a semi-plasma crash (Plasma being the DE I run on Linux, and lost my train of thought). Maybe I was thinking about talking about death, but it's something that comes to me more and more with each time I get FUCKED OVER by this a-hole of a fucking person. OT: I need to change space-space in vim to something else. Maybe Ctrl+space for the "jumping thing". Back on topic: why am I doing this when nothing is going to come out of this. It's just a wall of text that is going to go nowhere. I might put this up as a blog post, but I've already done something like that before with the same Soothing Relaxation music I'm listening to right now. Do I update that post with this wall of text with the names redacted? IDK.

I guess I'll just be stuck at school for an entire afternoon for the entire week just because the control freak in my family said no, and my dad is also a straight-up a-hole also: not even trying to help me. Remember that Rite of Passage thing I mentioned? I should be doing that (FUCK OFF LITTLE BROTHER AND YOUR SHITTY WIGGLES MUSIC. LET ME GO SABATOGE THAT RECORDING YOU'RE DOING) thing now, but once again, I'm procrastinating it off until the last minute where I stress over something that could have been done LITERALLY A FUCKING WEEK PRIOR. But "No, I hAd tO mAkE a ShItTy PoSt To SoMe GiTlAb RePo" (that kind of mess that gets you nowhere). 

*This post might be edited multiple times, and you sadly won't be able to see those edits due to the fact that I've locked down my GitLab repo.*

Here's that music that I was talking about (2020 edit: disabled):
