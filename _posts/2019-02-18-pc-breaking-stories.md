*All the times technology loved to hate on me.*

I've seemingly got some sort of curse on me. This curse is: any new device I get (with the exception of Linux) breaks on me on day one. Here's all the times I've done stupid things to computers to mess them up (or times they've messed up on me).

This was last updated: November 28, 2022

# Windows XP

- I've temporarily disabled my own computer by setting a password I forgot. Good thing safe mode exists.
- I think this one was hard drive corruption, but I had installed something LogMeIn (I think) on my parents PC (probably something Minecraft related), and after a reboot, that system never saw the light of day again (stuck at the Windows XP screen forever). I think we even let it sit for an entire day, and still nothing.
- Random BSOD's on a different computer. This same computer saw me installing audio drivers and accidentally switching to a different WiFi that wasn't my parents. Try loading iCarly.com on that slow of a speed.
- I nuked my eMachine system by removing a partition that I didn't know was important (I probably wanted more disk space). Be me, a little kid who didn't know what drivers and activation were at the time, and that system was gone forever. If only I knew about Ubuntu.
- Some random Dell laptop stopped loading completely. The device was broken eventually (screen came off or something).

# Windows Vista

- I had to deal with not my own system for once, and one AVG (or something) scan brought back a lot of files. This same system bricked itself during an update (see a trend?). Years later I had that system again with an non genuine copy of vista. That system saw Linux Mint (and a few other Ubuntu versions from DVDs), but eventually stopped working completely (constantly beeping before POST). I read online at the time it was probably something to do with RAM not being seated correctly, but I never took that thing apart to confirm or deny that.

# Windows 7

This is the start of my "day one" curse.

- I got a new ASUS laptop (a K53E to be specific), and it needed updates. I started them as normal, but canceled them for sone reason. This broke the system, so I had to system restore back to pre-updates. I'm lucky I knew about system restore (maybe that came from the XP system). After that point, I didn't do updates for years until a visit to the local tech support people (it was Geek Squad, who I have an entire post about) told my parents to tell me that I needed to do updates, and I did (with one of the slowest internet connections I've ever had to deal with).
- Fake Minecraft account generators screwing with my hosts file twice on the same system. The first time I had to do some survey (I don't know how it unlocked me, but OK), but the second time was some random redirect to some car site or something (maybe the IP used in the first one was taken over and moved to some other site). Only figured out what it was the second time when something with windows phone 8 or something on older, unsupported devices (at the time) mentioned it (XDA Developers?). Curse you hosts file! I had seen a video a long time ago about a simple prank with the hosts file, but didn't think much of it. I watched DanTDM after fixing the issue.
- My parents PC comes back for round 2 (this is the PC they got after the XP issues). Potential hard drive corruption again, so they had to get the data backed up and the hard drive replaced. This PC hasn't had any other weird issues except for a newer version of the graphics drivers being installed that don't work properly (this was on windows 10).

# Windows 8/8.1

- For the (I've lost track) time, fake Minecraft account generators got me, but on a completely different system. Had an iOS style alert come through the speakers and confused friends of family that were over (they thought I had an iPhone, but I had a Windows Phone). After the first time with Windows 7, I knew what to do. This came from one of those survey things. Boy am I thankful Webroot locks down that file (only found out when I tried to make legit changes to it for whatever reason).

# Windows 10

**The Windows 8/8.1 Laptop Strikes Back**
- Weird WiFi issues (this was the only system I ever had windows 8 on). Upgrading to the latest release of windows 10 that had just come out fixed it.
- Planned obsolescence is fun, isn't it? This system was unusable after a year or 2, so I eventually said "fuck it" and made the jump to KDE Neon. Distro-hopped on this thing until I landed on Xubuntu (now actually Arch in 2020).
- Insider versions are betas, OK? One of them broke on me. Enough said?

Side note: I had actually been messing with Ubuntu dual-booting on this laptop, but it failed because tutorials were saying to install GRUB to a separate partition. Why?

**Dell Laptop (my former laptop)**

- I failed to see a potential failure when the windows 10 upgrade assistant closed but the installer still opened (on christmas). One restore back to the previous version fixed this one.
- Random BSOD making booting impossible. I think pirating FL Studio and recording me editing some video in Sony Vegas with OBS wasn't a good idea. One reinstall later and this system is fine.
- Wifi was being fucky, so it got nuked and KDE Neon is now on this laptop.

Side note again: I want this system to break so I can nuke Windows and go for KDE Neon git stable (it did).

- Somehow it decided to drop off the face of existence one day when I was trying to do some testing with podsync. Yes, it was for CHAD (Chaos, Hope & Death, it's a hololive thing). Had to get an ASUS laptop to replace that one really quickly.

# The ASUS

- Not much happened with this one (other than Linux not liking the network card for a solid few months until I installed the right driver. Dual booted this thing with Windows with the NVME from the Gateway I stole from work (and yes: I still to this day question how in the hell I did it).

# The Mac

- Surprisingly, nothing has happened here. Somehow macOS is immune to my stupidity (or I've learned a lot since the last few years of breaking things).

**Cisco class + incompetent people = fun times (not times I've broken them, but some random things that have happened)**
- Windows feature updates are fun. Especially when you have work to do. That plus spinning rust drives is not fun whatsoever.
- On the topic of feature updates, one PC (maybe 2) have failed to properly update to the latest feature update (which at the time was 170-something). I did force it though.
- My teacher recommended the class to use **IE** for testing for the first test we took. Take a guess on how that worked out.
- Someone had a fake tech support popup show up (thanks Belarc Advisor!), and the teacher was slow to say how to fix it, saying she needed to know what was on the screen (although she could see it already, thanks Vision Client!). 2022 edit: I think the person that got that message was on the spectrum...
- Logged in and completely fucked Windows (explorer would open and close constantly) probably because I was logged in elsewhere.
- "Have I been a good girl this year santa?" - Some random porno one person mentioned to me (IDK why) and [Happy H. Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-J4fJ85ARs). \*visible cringe*

**Once again, breaking systems that aren't mine**
- My brothers new laptop on christmas broke with windows update (I'm cursed or something). System restore once again saved it. The system had to reboot because BIOS updates (Lenovo laptop).

# Linux?!?
Yes, even linux isn't safe from me fucking it up. This is on the Dell laptop on KDE Neon (day one of the install). Also my new "most recent fail".
- KDE Neon has the edge/palm detection options disabled for touchpads, so I made a file (following some stackexchange/overflow post) in the directors for X11. Rebooting this causing a blinking cursor. Hours of work GONE. Boot Repair from the install USB I used failed, but then it came to me: "what if it was that one synaptics file?". TURNS OUT: IT WAS (how else would I be making this edit)!
